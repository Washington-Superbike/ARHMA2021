The main file for bike firmware. This includes \mbox{\hyperlink{_main_8h}{Main.\+h}} which in turn interconnects all files and allows for access to the global variables. These variables are then passed along to all other files as pointers. Then it runs the setup methods for all those files and then it sets up RTOS to run all the different files as individual tasks. These tasks are\+: datalogging, display, precharge, CAN, idle. These tasks will be further described in the documentation for their individual files.

Main. The source for the entire firmware. Utilizes Arduino\textquotesingle{}s framework with void \mbox{\hyperlink{_main_8ino_a4fc01d736fe50cf5b977f755b675f11d}{setup()}} and void \mbox{\hyperlink{_main_8ino_afe461d27b9c48d5921c00d521181f12f}{loop()}} methods, but only void \mbox{\hyperlink{_main_8ino_a4fc01d736fe50cf5b977f755b675f11d}{setup()}} is used. Before the void \mbox{\hyperlink{_main_8ino_a4fc01d736fe50cf5b977f755b675f11d}{setup()}}, \mbox{\hyperlink{_main_8h}{Main.\+h}} is included into the file which in turn interconnects all files and allows for access to the global variables. These variables are what is eventually used in \mbox{\hyperlink{_main_8ino_a4fc01d736fe50cf5b977f755b675f11d}{setup()}} and all the helper methods, being passed along to all other files/tasks as pointers, allowing for them to updated and accessed at the same time. If \mbox{\hyperlink{_c_a_n_8ino}{Can.\+ino}} updates the motor\+Temperature, \mbox{\hyperlink{_display_8ino}{Display.\+ino}} has an updated value for the motor\+Temperature. Then the void setup will execute everything and also act as the loop. That is because the setup calls on the \mbox{\hyperlink{tasks_8c_ad138d9dda4709b10d711775fa40eb1a1}{x\+Task\+Create()}} method from the RTOS library and then the \mbox{\hyperlink{task_8h_aaf9dca1065c60abdeb309d56ab7293cb}{v\+Task\+Start\+Scheduler()}} method which in turn abstracts everything from us and rotates between all the tasks updating them and transferring resources as required. As of now, tasks operate on different resources than each other, thus there is no need for semaphores, however, if that is changed in the future, there is an example line of creating a semaphore above the calls to the \mbox{\hyperlink{tasks_8c_ad138d9dda4709b10d711775fa40eb1a1}{x\+Task\+Create()}} method. The breakdown of how these methods and variables work in detail are explained further in the documentation closer for those methods and variables specifically. Please make sure to read and understand everything before you make any changes to this firmware.

\begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
As of 3/1/2023, I think this firmware is fully race-\/ready and meeting all requirements to race. Ideally, I would use HIL and their CAN interface to further test the requirements and ensure proper performance under race-\/communication circumstances, but I\textquotesingle{}m just tired, you guys can do that while testing everything else next quarter. As of now, my goal is to create full documentation for this codebase and train up all members to be able to use it without any trouble.
\end{DoxyNote}
\begin{DoxyRefDesc}{Todo}
\item[\mbox{\hyperlink{todo__todo000008}{Todo}}]Refine further. ~\newline
 ~\newline
 Look for redundant variables, pins, etc and remove. ~\newline
 ~\newline
 Change the name of pre\+Charge. It\textquotesingle{}s not just pre\+Charge now, I personally like the name \char`\"{}controls.\+ino\char`\"{} and \char`\"{}controls.\+h\char`\"{}. Make sure you change the \#includes as well if you do that. Please Please change \char`\"{}pre\+Charge\char`\"{} or whatever it\textquotesingle{}s called to not use this many global/struct variables. It doesn\textquotesingle{}t need everything globalized, it can pass them as parameters and eventually output to global variables $\ast$pre\+Charge.angle\+\_\+X and $\ast$pre\+Charge.angle\+\_\+Y. ~\newline

\begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
Just a basic helper method that takes control of the spi\+Mutex which is used as an example line in \mbox{\hyperlink{_main_8h_a4fc01d736fe50cf5b977f755b675f11d}{setup()}} but not actually used in the current \mbox{\hyperlink{tasks_8c_ad138d9dda4709b10d711775fa40eb1a1}{x\+Task\+Create()}} methods or this RTOS in general. ~\newline
 ~\newline
The purpose of a mutex is to create a sort of indication to the RTOS that there is a specific resource being used for a specific task and to not begin any other task that interrupts this specific resource, like the pins used for the SPI protocol for this case, etc. etc. ~\newline
 ~\newline
Please read up on Mutex, etc. in the RTOS documentation to make sure you use it correctly. This is only necessary if there are different tasks with two different devices using the same communication protocol.

\begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
\mbox{\hyperlink{_main_8h_a4fc01d736fe50cf5b977f755b675f11d}{setup()}} calls on all the helper methods in \mbox{\hyperlink{_main_8ino}{Main.\+ino}}. These helper methods serve to initialize all pin modes, package all variables from \mbox{\hyperlink{_main_8h}{Main.\+h}} into structs, initialize all communication protocols (as of now, just I2C), and then use those packaged structs to call on the RTOS \mbox{\hyperlink{tasks_8c_ad138d9dda4709b10d711775fa40eb1a1}{x\+Task\+Create()}} to then send the variables off to various tasks with no issues. \mbox{\hyperlink{tasks_8c_ad138d9dda4709b10d711775fa40eb1a1}{x\+Task\+Create()}} takes in a function name (pointer to an existing function which contains the essence of the task (these exist in the different files)), a label (string), stack size (integer/number), the parameters required for that task (a void pointer to the packaged structs from before) and lastly a task priority. There\textquotesingle{}s another variable but it\textquotesingle{}s kinda useless for our case and is only discussed in the detailed discussion below. ~\newline
 ~\newline
 Taking from the Free\+RTOS documentation, the parameters serve the following DETAILED purposes. ~\newline
 ~\newline
pv\+Task\+Code aka the pointer to the function used for the task. This function is usually an infinite loop with an RTOS VTask\+Delay() call which will be further elaborated on within those functions in the documentation. ~\newline
 ~\newline
pc\+Name aka the string with the funciton name. This is ususally used for debugging purposes. us\+Stack\+Depth is the number of words to allocate for the task\textquotesingle{}s stack (for those of you who havent had a chance to take CSE 374 or CSE 351, stack is dynamic memory, thus if any of your tasks use a lot of parameters or perform recursion, the stack size might have to be increased). Display has often been a victim of the stack size being too small in the past. ~\newline
 ~\newline
pv\+Parameters aka the void pointer to the struct composed of the variables declared in \mbox{\hyperlink{_main_8h}{Main.\+h}}. Just a simple void pointer which is passed to the task when it executes. While passing variables and being careful with memory leaks is not too much of a concern thanks to the Arduino framework, it is still important to use good practices like this void pointer task memory unit to avoid any issues (plus RTOS just requires something to be passed through anyway). ~\newline
 ~\newline
ux\+Priority aka the priority at which the task will execute. Lower priority numbers indicate tasks with lower priority in execution. That is, while the RTOS is constantly swapping between your tasks, ensuring they execute properly, etc the higher priority tasks are given highest priority to run once the CPU is ready. Just makes sense really. ~\newline
 ~\newline
px\+Created\+Task is a variable that is used to pass a handle to the created task outside of the \mbox{\hyperlink{tasks_8c_ad138d9dda4709b10d711775fa40eb1a1}{x\+Task\+Create()}} function. That means the ??? IDK it\textquotesingle{}s not needed. 
\end{DoxyNote}
First this method calls on \mbox{\hyperlink{_main_8ino_a31d554847ae8fdeaba2460e0395cb75f}{setup\+Pins()}} to set certain pins to output and input. This initializes how the pins will be used and interact with peripherals for the rest of the runtime of the firmware.

Then this method calls on \mbox{\hyperlink{_main_8ino_a128d10ba9e06eb69d1dfc91ffef935ba}{initialize\+Display\+Structs()}} to map the static variables from \mbox{\hyperlink{_main_8h}{Main.\+h}} from to a struct that is used for the \mbox{\hyperlink{_display_8ino_abbc2dd9c7d8fc4714a0379f70d919047}{display\+Task()}}

Then this method calls on \mbox{\hyperlink{_main_8ino_ab91267714bdf99d7b3d177f95f484157}{initialize\+CANStructs()}} to map the static variables from \mbox{\hyperlink{_main_8h}{Main.\+h}} from to a struct that is used for the \mbox{\hyperlink{_c_a_n_8h_a785e095da30ce4993a186804102bf2ea}{can\+Task()}}

Then this method calls on \mbox{\hyperlink{_main_8ino_a797cf3c70ce7ae02bba9bfd3f6d886de}{initialize\+Log\+Structs()}} to map the static variables from \mbox{\hyperlink{_main_8h}{Main.\+h}} from to a struct that is used for the \mbox{\hyperlink{_data_logging_8h_a24f7ab7e53619e5770ad9acc25b9b819}{data\+Logging\+Task()}}

Then this method calls on \mbox{\hyperlink{_main_8ino_a32469c898d757b2b30c00d0546f91802}{initialize\+Pre\+Charge\+Struct()}} to map the static variables from \mbox{\hyperlink{_main_8h}{Main.\+h}} from to a struct that is used for the \mbox{\hyperlink{_pre_charge_8ino_a2cd6f5c27d7667dbd0b6a0bc756340a3}{precharge\+Task()}}

Then this method initializes Serial communication using Serial.\+begin() initializing Serial at a baud rate of 115200.

\begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
DISCLAIMER\+: When first running this code on a fresh board, the time will not properly update to Pacific Standard, or any real-\/looking time. Instead it will update to whatever default value is on the teensy board RTC (real-\/time clock). Thus, to set the Teensy RTC to the real world clock, you need to upload the sketch\+: ~\newline
 ~\newline
File-\/\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}Examples-\/\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}Time-\/\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}Time\+Teensy3 and open the serial port. That will set the internal time to the time on the laptop I believe, or connects to the internet somehow to determine the \char`\"{}current\char`\"{} time. This next line calls with the statement set\+Time(Teensy3\+Clock.\+get()) sets the current stored time to the time stored in the internal RTC in the Teensy, allowing for Teensy time from the internal RTC (powered by the coin cell).

Then this method starts the SD Card and prints the status if that works.

Then this method calls on the \mbox{\hyperlink{_display_8h_a756efac71e8cf83b5add1ffcb9035a20}{setup\+Display()}} method which just initializes variables that are used by the \mbox{\hyperlink{_display_8ino_abbc2dd9c7d8fc4714a0379f70d919047}{display\+Task()}}

Then this method calls on the \mbox{\hyperlink{_c_a_n_8h_a833ae6516ecb5cb3f8a7bd5adbf2bd9b}{setup\+CAN()}} method which just initializes the CAN bus at a baud rate of 250000. And then begins the CAN bus.

Then this method calls on the \mbox{\hyperlink{_precharge_8h_a5782bd590f95fb2269eb43a3d70c18f4}{setup\+I2\+C()}} method which just initializes the I2C communication protocol, setting the clock to 40KHz, reading in the initial values of the gyroscope, taking $\sim$2 seconds worth of data to calibrate.

The main and most important function of setup is initializing the tasks using \mbox{\hyperlink{tasks_8c_ad138d9dda4709b10d711775fa40eb1a1}{x\+Task\+Create()}}. The details of parameters are explained in the Note at the start of \mbox{\hyperlink{_main_8ino_a4fc01d736fe50cf5b977f755b675f11d}{setup()}}. The stack sizes are edited in \mbox{\hyperlink{_main_8h}{Main.\+h}} and the priorities are logically assigned for \mbox{\hyperlink{_precharge_8h_a3a618d104e1f329b2aad074b706db5c9}{pre\+Charge\+Task()}} with highest priority 5, \mbox{\hyperlink{_c_a_n_8h_a785e095da30ce4993a186804102bf2ea}{can\+Task()}} with second highest priority 4 since it contains data that can be used to trigger Off states for \mbox{\hyperlink{_precharge_8h_a3a618d104e1f329b2aad074b706db5c9}{pre\+Charge\+Task()}}. data\+Logging() is 3, it\textquotesingle{}s important to update the stored data from the race, but it\textquotesingle{}s more important to shutdown the bike if batteries are dying. \mbox{\hyperlink{_display_8ino_abbc2dd9c7d8fc4714a0379f70d919047}{display\+Task()}} is a 2 because see aforementioned reasoning for data\+Logging(). \mbox{\hyperlink{_main_8ino_a0d7297755c0775a9b0e4f7eeeafd7c7e}{idle\+Task()}} is a 1 ideally we never want to idle unless everything is taken care of and the teensy is that powerful.

Then, the firmware checks if the tasks passed, if they failed, it stays in a loop printing error creating tasks.

Lastly the method prints out that it will attempt to start the scheduler. If this succeeds, only lines from the task methods should know execute.

If this fails, the method prints out insufficient RAM and breaks.
